# Basic Landing Page

## Overview
This simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum to test what was learned of JavaScript so far.

## Features
The game is console-based. A prompt asks the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. If the user selects one of these options, the game continues. If the user doesn't enter a valid response, an alert is displayed to inform the user to enter a valid response. The user will be prompted again until they enter a valid response or click Cancel. If the user clicks Cancel, the game is ended. If the game is played, 5 rounds are played against a computer. The computer's choice is randomized each round. Feedback is displayed to indicate the result of each round. Once all 5 rounds are played, the game is ended (if the user doesn't end the game sooner by clicking Cancel).

## What I Learned
Since I haven't used JavaScript in a while, this project was great practice. It helped put together all that I've learned so far in The Odin Project along with what I've previously learned on my own. I also utilized the previous lessons in The Odin Project curriculum on problem solving and debugging, which helped me break down larger problems into smaller problems and debug any errors that occurred.
